# asteroids

A rendition of the classic 1980's arcade game [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) with SDL2 and C++.
This project makes use of the [entity/component design pattern](http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/) and message passing (observer pattern)
to make the game's implementation as data driven and reusable as possible.

Assets not included.
